## About

> Hello! I'm Marlowe, and I am a Software Engineer. With my natural curiosity and strong analytical skills, I have experience taking a larger vision, breaking it down, and then devising and executing effective solutions.

Growing up in western New York, I decided to move to sunny Florida and study geology at the University of Miami. Along with minors in math and classics, I graduated at the start of the pandemic. When the world started to open up again, I longed to try something completely new.... So I took the initiative to move to Prague and teach English. It was the scariest thing I'd ever done and the best decision I ever made.

I taught preschoolers in an immersive English school, and I will never forget the kiddos or my time there. I think they taught me more than I taught them! While there, I began to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through an online course at the University of Michigan.

When I moved back to the States, I became a student at Flatiron School in the software engineering bootcamp and graduated in March 2023. I am now searching for the right position at which to begin my professional software development career, and I couldn't be more excited!
